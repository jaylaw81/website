    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to style web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is a cornerstone specification of the web and almost all web pages use CSS style sheets to describe their presentation. CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.[1] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple pages to share formatting, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content (such as by allowing for tableless web design). It obviates those portions of markup that would specify presentation by instead providing that information in a separate file. For each relevant HTML element (identified by tags), it provides a list of formatting instructions. For example, it might say (in CSS syntax), "All heading 1 elements should be bold." Therefore, no formatting markup such as bold tags (<b></b>)is needed within the content; what is needed is simply semantic markup saying, "this text is a level 1 heading." <a class="pi-padding-left-10" href="/rhinocoders/the-series/css/">Get the details here.</a></p></p>
