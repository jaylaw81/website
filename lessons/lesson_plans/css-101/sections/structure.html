    <h4>CSS Basic Structure</h4>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is code used to control the visible and invisible properties of the elements and content in your page. It is commonly used to control the page's color scheme, the structural layout of the page and shape of elements. It can also be used to control properties of fonts (uniquely created alphabet characters) and the different states of an anchor. There are many advanced ways to use CSS that you may learn in your journey of learing web design and development.</p>

    <h4>How CSS selectors work</h4>
    <p>A CSS rule set consists of a selector and a declaration block:</p>
    <div class="">
        <img style="width:569px;height:119px;" alt="CSS selector" src="/assets/img/lessons/css-101/css-syntax.gif">
    </div>
    <ul>
		<li>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</li>
		<li>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</li>
		<li>Each declaration includes a property name and a value, separated by a colon.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration groups are surrounded by curly braces:</p>

	<div class="instruction-block">
	    <h2>Do it yourself!</h2>
	    <ol>
	        <li>In Sublime Text Edit, open the css file you have created</li>
	        <li>You can copy and paste the "p" tag styles from here to your file and then change any values to see differences.</li>
	        <li>Save your file and reload your HTML page to see the changes.</li>
	    </ol>
	</div>
	    










    <p>When controlling the shape and size of elements on the page there are Unites of Measure available for you to use. Below are the three most commonly used units.</p>

    <h4>Units of Measure - Commonly Used in Web Pages</h4>
    <ul class="table-layout">
    	<li>
    		<div>%</div>
    		<div>Percentage - Usually used to control the percentage of an element's width or height of it's parent width or height.</div>
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		<div>px</div>
    		<div>pixels (a dot on the computer screen) - Screen resolution is generally 32 pixels per inch.</div>
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		<div>em</div>
    		<div>1em is equal to the current font size. 2em means 2 times the size of the current font. E.g., if an element is displayed with a font of 12 pt, then '2em' is 24 pt. The 'em' is a very useful unit in CSS, since it can adapt automatically to the font that the reader uses</div>
    	</li>
    </ul>

EXAMPLE CODE BLOCKS

<p class="gist-code" data-gist="rhinocoders/bb48b9aee9ceec6dc934"></p>


<div class="instruction-block">
    <h2>Do it yourself!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In Sublime Text Edit, open your index.html file</li>
        <li>Code the meta data content as shown above</li>
        <li>Save your index.html file</li>
    </ol>
</div>



<dl class="definition">
    <dt><span class="icon-book"></span> Metadata</dt>
    <dd>
        Metadata is "data about data". So that means we have descriptive information about our data object. For instance, contained within a .jpg or image file is more information about the picture like the date, time, and location where the image was taken. In the case of a website we use metadata or&lt;meta&gt; tags to describe our website and provide information about it. This helps search engines and users find our site.  Some common meta data attributes title, description, keywords and author. Let's take the time to fill out this information in your html template.
    </dd>
