    <ul>
    	<li><strong>:link</strong>: Perhaps the most confusion-causing link-related pseudo selector. Aren't all <a> links? Well not if they don't have an href attribute. This selects only those that do, thus is essentially the same as a[href]. This selector will become a lot more useful should any-element linking become reality.</li>

		<li><strong>:visited</strong>: Selects links that have already been visited by the current browser.</li>

		<li><strong>:hover</strong>: When the mouse cursor rolls over a link, that link is in it's hover state and this will select it.</li>

		<li><strong>:active</strong>: Selects the link while it is being activated (being clicked on or otherwise activated). For example, for the "pressed" state of a button-style link or to make all links feel more button-like.</li>

		<li><strong>:first-child</strong>: Selects the first element within a parent.</li>

		<li><strong>:last-child</strong>: Selects the last element within a parent.</li>
	<ul>
