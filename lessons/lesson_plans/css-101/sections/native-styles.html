        <p>Have you ever opened an HTML file that was not controlled by a style sheet? Chances are, if you have, that it
            looked something like this.</p>

        <p>It sometimes referred to as 'unstyled content'. While it certainly looks unstyled, but that's not entirely
            accurate. Before developers were allowed to control HTML pages through Cascading Style Sheets, browsers had some
            way of displaying HTML content visually that means it added styling (naturally) on some elements. </p>

        <p>When you write CSS, one of the things you are actually doing is overriding those default browser styles and
            replacing them with how you want the page to look,choose your own fonts, what size your text should display
            etc,.</p>

    </div>

    <div style="clear: both;">
        <p>Every browser has their own way of default styling. This is both useful and annoying in different situations.
            Let's say for example you created a basic webpage that looked something like the following:</p>
    </div>

<xmp>
    <!DOCTYPE html>

        <html>
        <head>
            <title>Untitled</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        <div id="container">
            <ul id="nav">
                <li>Home</li>
                <li>About</li>
                <li>Portfolio</li>
                <li>Contact</li>
            </ul>

            <div id="mainContent">
                <h1>Main Content!</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        </body>
        </html>

</xmp>

    <p>In the above snippet with no associated CSS stylings, browsers will give unordered list a default bullet, make
        the H1 bigger and bolder than other text on the page, with extra margins around it (most noticeably on the h1).
        This is all well and good for the most part, however in some cases it can cause some unintended behavior because
        different browsers have different default stylings (one might create a margin of 10px on a h1 while another uses
        15px).</p>

    <p>Now how to fix these style problem caused by the browser. One way is to simply check the page as you develop and
        if anything seems wrong then you can correct it during -- let's say a heading wasn't positioned where you
        thought you told it to for example, it may be a good idea to set margin: 0; to see if the default margin was
        affecting with your positioning, and if this was causing the problem then you can tweak the margin from there.
        once you've cleared out browser styles, you can start styling same</p>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 10px; width: 619px; height: 297px;">
        <img src="/assets/img/lessons/css-101/bundler.png" alt="default styles" />
    </div>

    <p>NORMALIZE: Some people, however, go all out and completely remove any default styles that the browser might have
        so they have complete control, this is usually achieved using something called a "Reset Stylesheet". This
        neutralizes (or normalizes) browser defaults and sets consistent style across. THen you have a clean and
        sensible default slate to work from</p>
