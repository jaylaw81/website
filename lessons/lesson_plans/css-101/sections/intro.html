        <dd>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to change the style web pages and user interfaces written in HTML. CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.</dd>
