            <dd>A loop is a fundamental programming concept that is commonly used in writing programs. Typically, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. Once the condition is reached an action may occur or the program may cease to run and move on to the next sequential task. </dd>

        <p>In javascript there are several different types of loops. There are the for, for/in, while and do/while loops please see the glossary for in-depth defintions of the different types of loops while we focus on the use of the For loop.</p>

            <dd>The For loop, loops through a block of code a number of times based on a conditional statement.</dd>
