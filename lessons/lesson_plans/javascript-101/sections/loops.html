         <h4>Loops and the For Loop</h4>

            <dd>A loop is a fundamental programming concept that is commonly used in writing programs. Typically, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. Once the condition is reached an action may occur or the program may cease to run and move on to the next sequential task. </dd>

        <p>In javascript there are several different types of loops. A loop is used as mechanism to complete work and execute blocks of code. There are the for, for/in, while and do/while loops please see the glossary for in-depth defintions of the different types of loops while we focus on the use of the For loop.</p>
         <dl class="definition">
            <dt><span class="icon-book"></span>For Loop</dt>
            <dd>The For loop, loops through a block of code a number of times based on a conditional statement.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl class="definition" style="display: none">
            <dt><span class="icon-book"></span>For/In Loop</dt>
            <dd>The For/In loop, loops through the properties of an object.</dd>
        </dl>
         <dl class="definition" style="display: none">
            <dt><span class="icon-book"></span>While Loop</dt>
            <dd>The while loop, loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</dd>
        </dl>
         <dl class="definition" style="display: none">
            <dt><span class="icon-book"></span>Do/While Loop</dt>
            <dd>The Do/While, executes the block of code once and then will loop through the code while the condition is true.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl class="definition" style="display: none">
            <dt><span class="icon-book"></span>Do/While Loop</dt>
            <dd>The Do/While, executes the block of code once and then will loop through the code while the condition is true.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Lets take a look at the for loop eample below, where we've created an array and the for loop iterates through the array and writes the contents to our console</P>

        <div class="instruction-block">
            <h2>Do it yourself!</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Open your browser's conosle.</li>
                <li>You can copy and paste the for loop examples into your console and run the code to see the for loop results.</li>
                <li>After running the code in your conslole you should see each of the names from my array output in your console.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
