        <h4>Introduction to Varaibles</h4>

        <p>In most if not all scripting languages you will find at least one thing they have in common and that is the use of variables. Not all languages define thier variables the same way but variables none the less serve the same purpose. Variables give developers a way to assign code to something that can be later reference when needed. Much like a word in a dictionary, a word is created and given a name and a definition is assigned to it. That definition has meaning. So when you talk to a person and say the word, the person understands what you mean.</p> 
        <p>Unlike a word in a dictionary, a varaible can be re-assigned definitions and change in value when needed.</p>

        <dl class="definition" style="display:none">
            <dt><span class="icon-book"></span> JS Variable Declaration</dt>
            <dd>
                 The variable Declaration begins with "var" and followed by the name given to the variable. The definition is defined by the "name equals value" and the definition is ended with a simocolon.
                 declairation name = string | number | array | object | function;
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h4>Commonly Variable Uses</h4>
        <p><strong>The String</strong> - A varaible can be given what is known as a String value. A string is any arrangement of characters that is wrapped within single or double quotations. String variables can be used to store parts of data that can later be combined to make a complete set of data.</p>

        <div class="instruction-block">
            <h2>Do it yourself!</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Open your browser's conosle.</li>
                <li>You can copy and paste the String examples into your cosole and change the values to see different results.</li>
                <li>Save the String varaibles into your JS file for reference and later use.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p><strong>The Integer</strong> - A varaible can be given what is known as an Integer value. An integer is a number and can be used in math equations or in the process of an itteration. There are methods that can convert numbers into strings and strings into numbers if the string only contains number characters. </p>

        <div class="instruction-block">
            <h2>Do it yourself!</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Open your browser's conosle.</li>
                <li>You can copy and paste the Integer examples into your cosole and change the values to see different results.</li>
                <li>Save the Integer varaibles into your JS file for reference and later use.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p><strong>The Array</strong> - A varaible can be given what is known as a Array value. An Array is a comma separated collection values and are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Each section of an array is referred to as an index. The index is the order in which values appear in an Array.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Open your browser's conosle.</li>
                <li>You can copy and paste the Array examples into your cosole and change the values to see different results.</li>
                <li>Save the Array variables into your JS file for reference and later use.</li>
            </ol>
