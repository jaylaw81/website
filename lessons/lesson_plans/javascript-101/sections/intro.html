            <dd>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. It is also used in server-side network programming with frameworks such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.</dd>

        <h5>Usages</h5>
        <p>The most common use of JavaScript is to add client-side behavior to HTML pages, a.k.a. Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML pages and interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. Some simple examples of this usage are:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Loading new page content or submitting data to the server via AJAX without reloading the page (for example, a social network might allow the user to post status updates without leaving the page)</li>
    		<li>Animation of page elements, fading them in and out, resizing them, moving them, etc.</li>
    		<li>Interactive content, for example games, and playing audio and video</li>
    		<li>Validating input values of a web form to make sure that they are acceptable before being submitted to the server.</li>
    		<li>Transmitting information about the user's reading habits and browsing activities to various websites. Web pages frequently do this for web analytics, ad tracking, personalization or other purposes.</li>

		<p>Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on a remote server), the browser can respond to user actions quickly, making an application more responsive. Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect user actions which HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. Applications such as Gmail take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. The wider trend of Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.</p>

        <h5>References</h5>
        <ul>
        	<li><strong>Script Tag:</strong> The most widely used reference, is done by loading in a JavaScript file in the body of the page, after all the HTML. Sometimes there are multiple JavaScript files to be loaded on the page. It is important to load them in proper order and to not have too many.

            </li>
        	<li><strong>Script Block:</strong> Used rarely, is to provide a small block of JavaScript in the HTML file itself.
