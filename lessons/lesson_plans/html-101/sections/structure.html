    <h5>Basic HTML Structure</h5>
    <p>As we mentioned earlier Html is the skeleton or structure of a webpage. Let's dive right in with the essential elements and basic structure of a web page by creating a Hello World page. <br/>This is a common first exercise when learning any programming language. Below you'll notice the code sample of our page and the tags that make up this very basic page.</p><br/>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/rhinocoders/3d55d114602324ea5050.js"></script><br/>
    <p>Let's take some time and create this page.</p> <p>Once you're done, let's save that as hello_world.html and preview in your browser by right clicking the saved file and choosing the firefox browser to preview the web page. If everything went well you should see your Hello World page.</p>
    <p>Now that we've built our first page lets talk about all of the elements or tags that make up the structure of our page.</p>
    <0l>
        <li>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration tag. This communicates to the browser what version of html the page is written in. Please note that this tag does not have a closing tag.</li>
        <li>The &lt;html&gt; tag which tells the browser that this is an html document. The html tag contains all of the other html elements aside from the DOCTYPE declaration. You'll notice that at the very end of the code is the html closing tag.</li>
        <li>The &lt;head&gt; tag. The head element contains the page  &lt;title&gt;,  &lt;meta&gt; data (which is information about our page), links to css style sheets, and scripts.</li>
        <li>The  &lt;body&gt; tag contains all of the contents of the html document, text, images , videos, lists, etc.</li>
        <li>The &lt;h1&gt; tag is a heading tag which contains our Hello world text.</li>
    </0l>

    <h5>HTML Attributes</h5>

            <li>Attributes provide <strong>additional information</strong> about an element.</li>
            <li>Attributes are always specified in the <strong>start tag</strong>.</li>
            <li>Attributes come in name/value pairs like: <strong>name="value"</strong></li>
