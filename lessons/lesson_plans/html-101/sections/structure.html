    <h3 id="intro-structure" class="section">HTML Structure</h3>

    <h4>Basic HTML Structure</h4>
    <p>HTML is the structure of a webpage. Lets learn the essential elements and basic structure of a web page by creating a Hello World page. <br/>This is a common first exercise when learning any programming language. Below you'll notice the code sample of our page and the tags that make up this very basic page.</p>
    <p>Before we buil our first page lets talk about all of the elements that make up the structure of our page.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
        The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration tag. This communicates to the browser what version of html the page is written in. Please note that this tag does not have a closing tag.
        </li>
        <li>The &lt;html&gt; tag which tells the browser that this is an html document. The html tag contains all of the other html elements aside from the DOCTYPE declaration. You'll notice that at the very end of the code is the html closing tag.
        </li>
        <li>The &lt;head&gt; tag. The head element contains the page  &lt;title&gt;,  &lt;meta&gt; data (which is information about our page), links to css style sheets, and scripts.

        </li>
        <li>The  &lt;body&gt; tag contains all of the contents of the html document, text, images , videos, lists, etc.</li>
        <li>The &lt;h1&gt; tag is a heading tag which contains our Hello world text.</li>
    </ol><br />
    <dl class="definition" style="display:none">
        <dt><span class="icon-book"></span> DOCTYPE declaration tag</dt>
        <dd>
            This communicates to the browser what version of html the page is written in. Please note that this tag does not have a closing tag.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl class="definition" style="display:none">
        <dt><span class="icon-book"></span> HEAD tag</dt>
        <dd>
            The head element contains the page  &lt;title&gt;,  &lt;meta&gt; data (which is information about our page), links to css style sheets, and scripts.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl class="definition" style="display:none">
        <dt><span class="icon-book"></span> BODY tag</dt>
        <dd>
            The body tag contains all of the contents of the html document, text, images , videos, lists, etc.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="gist-code" data-gist="rhinocoders/3d55d114602324ea5050"></p>

    <div class="instruction-block">
        <h2>Do it yourself!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open Sublime Text Edit</li>
            <li>Create a new file: File > New File</li>
            <li>Code a basic html document with the code shown above.</li>
            <li>Save the file as index.html</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <i>Now that we've created our Hello world page, did any of you have problems getting the page to display correctly?<br /> In web development, often when we have an issue with a page rendering correctly or a script not working correctly it's a <strong>syntax</strong> error.</i>
    <br /><br />

    <h3>What is syntax?</h3>

    <dl class="definition">
        <dt><span class="icon-book"></span> Syntax</dt>
        <dd>
            is the set of rules that a programming language needs to use in order for the computer to interpret them properly. Machines are not flexible and can only interpret the code correctly when it's in the expected form or syntax.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>HTML Element Syntax</h3>
    <p>The elements of an HTML document need to be structured with the proper syntax in order for the page to be viewed correctly.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An HTML element starts with a <b>start tag / opening tag</b> : &lt;p&gt;</li>
        <li>An HTML element ends with an <b>end tag / closing tag</b> : &lt;/p&gt;</li>
        <li>The <b>element content</b> is everything between the start and the end tag</li>
        <li>Some HTML elements have <b>empty content</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Empty elements are closed in the start tag : &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Most HTML elements can have <b>attributes</b> which we'll learn about later</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Below are some examples showing the correct syntax.</p>
    <p class="gist-code" data-gist="rhinocoders/c839338079580891d39f"></p>


    <h3>Common HTML Tags - Also known as Elements</h3>
    <p>Next we are going to take a look at some common HTML tags used to mark up copy and place images. In the sections below we can see the actual mark up and how the browser renders each element. HTML elements can be used for structure and contain content or other elements or can be used for formatting content. The container element is known as the parent and the element being contained is known as the child. A group of elements inside of a container are known as siblings.</p>

    <h4>Container Tags / Element Examples: HTML4</h4>

    <div class="side-by-side">
        <p class="gist-code" data-gist="rhinocoders/bb48b9aee9ceec6dc934"></p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>I'm a paragraph and I like to tell you things.</p>

            A div is a container element used to layout and contain other elements.
            <div>
                <p>Our parent is a DIV and I am its first-child.<p>
                <p>I'm one of the siblings - like a brother or sister.<p>
                <p>I'm the other sibling and known as the last-child<p>
            </div>

            I'm an Ordered List and I will show you a numbered list - like a to-do list. Each line is calle a List Item.
            <ol>
              <li>I am a list item</li>
              <li>I am also a list item</li>
              <li>I am the last list item</li>
            </ol>

            I'm an Unordered List and I will show you a list with symbols instead of numbers - like a check list. The element in each line is called a List Item.
            <ul>
              <li>I am a list item</li>
              <li>I am also a list item</li>
              <li>I am the last list item</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>


    <h4>Format Tags / Element Examples: HTML4</h4>
    <div class="side-by-side">
        <p class="gist-code" data-gist="rhinocoders/89c42b7c1838536c1354"></p>
        <div class="example">
            I'm a span element and I'm used to group text inline and make changes to it. <span style="color:blue">Like turning the text blue!</span>
            <br />
            I'm a <b>BOLD</b> tag and I make words look think and puffy.
            <br />
            I'm a <i>Itallic</i> tag and I make words look like they are leaning forward.
            <br />
            I'm a <u>Underline</u> tag and I make a line under words.
        </div>
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <h4>Headline Tags / Element Examples: HTML4</h4>
    <p>Heading tags are another way to format text. Below we see and example of headline tags. There are six levels of the headline tags. The lower the number, the larger the size of the words. In later courses you will learn how to control and override the sizes of these elements as they appear to users.</p>

    <div class="side-by-side">
        <p class="gist-code" data-gist="rhinocoders/7452422564a2b4767147"></p>
        <div class="example">
            <h1>I am the largest of the headline tags</h1>
            <br />
            <h2>I am the second largest headline</h2>
            <br />
            <h3>I am the third largest headline</h3>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Empty Tags / Element Examples: HTML4</h4>
    <p>Elements are referred to as empty they do not have content contained between an OPEN and CLOSE tags</p>






    <div class="side-by-side">
        <p class="gist-code" data-gist="rhinocoders/1e16d1142ebdab379348"></p>
        <div class="example">
            I'm an Image tag and I like to show you pictures like this 
            <img alt="RhinoCoders" src="/assets/img/rhinocoders-logo.jpg"> in web pages.
            <br />
            I'm a Break tag <br /> I don't have any content. All I do is create
            <br />
            a new line space<br />
            between other tags or content.
            <br />
            I'm a Horizontal Row tag and I don't have any content. All I do is create 
            <hr />
            a visible line
            <hr />
            between other tags or content.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Clickable Tags / Elements Examples: HTML4</h4>
    <div class="side-by-side">
        <p class="gist-code" data-gist="rhinocoders/19a935feb39fb25a7289"></p>
        <div class="example">
            I am an anchor tag and I am used to link to other web pages or other parts of the web page. <a href="#anchor-clicked">I'm a link - Click ME :)</a>
            <br>
            I am a Radio button and you will always see me with at least one sibling. We all want to play but only one of us can be chosen. We always have labels and our label tells you who you are picking to play with.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="kid" value="bobby"><label>Bobby</lable>
            <input type="radio" name="kid" value="jessica"><label>Jessica</lable>
            <br>
            I am a Radio button and you will always see me with at least one sibling. We all want to play but only one of us can be chosen. We always have labels and our label tells you who you are picking to play with.<br>
            <input type="checkbox" name="kid" value="bobby"><label>Bobby</lable>
            <input type="checkbox" name="kid" value="jessica"><label>Jessica</lable>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="image-caption">
        <p>What's a Meta tag and why are they important?</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/lessons/html-101/Meta-tags.jpg" alt="MetaTags">
    </div>

    <dl class="definition">
        <dt><span class="icon-book"></span> Metadata</dt>
        <dd>
            Metadata is "data about data". So that means we have descriptive information about our data object. For instance, contained within a .jpg or image file is more information about the picture like the date, time, and location where the image was taken. In the case of a website we use metadata or&lt;meta&gt; tags to describe our website and provide information about it. This helps search engines and users find our site.  Some common meta data attributes title, description, keywords and author. Let's take the time to fill out this information in your html template.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="gist-code" data-gist="rhinocoders/9b83e354ac9dfeda34f5"></p>
    <div class="instruction-block">
        <h2>Do it yourself!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In Sublime Text Edit, open your index.html file</li>
            <li>Code the meta data content as shown above</li>
            <li>Save your index.html file</li>
        </ol>
    </div>


<h3>Exploring Element Attributes</h3>
<p>HTML elements can have <b>attributes</b>, which provide additional information about the element. Atrributes are always contained within the starting tag of an element. Let's look at a couple of elements that contain attributes.</p>
<p class="gist-code" data-gist="rhinocoders/057c0a95f8dbe7f5284f"></p>
<br>
<p>Our first example is the image tag, which contains a number of attribute tags that tell the browser different thinga about the image element.</p>
<ul><b>Image Attributes</b>
    <li><b>Width and Height</b> - tells the browser the height and width of the image.</li>
    <li><b>Title</b> - acts as a caption for the image and is displayed on hover.</li>
    <li><b>Alt</b> - provides alternate text when the image element cannot be displayed. This element is also used by screen readers to read content to users that are visiually impaired.</li>
    <li><b>Anchor tag Attributes</b>
    <li><b>href</b> Provides the destination URL or location for the anchor tag</li>
    <li><b>target</b> Provides the target for the link will it open in the same tab or window using target="_self"? Or will it open in a new tab or window, target="_blank"</li>
</ul>

<div class="instruction-block">
    <h2>Do it yourself!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In Sublime Text Edit, open your index.html file</li>
        <li>Code the image tag and the unordered list as shown above</li>
        <li>Save your index.html file</li>
    </ol>
</div>
