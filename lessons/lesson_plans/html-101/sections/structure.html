    <h5>Basic HTML Structure</h5>
    <p>As we previously discussed html is the skeleton or structure of a webpage. Let's dive right in with the essential elements and the basic structure of an html page and create a Hello World page. <br/>This is a common first exercise when learning any programming language. Below you'll notice the code sample of our page and the tags that make up this very basic page.</p><br/>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/rhinocoders/3d55d114602324ea5050.js"></script><br/>
    <p>Let's take some time and create this page. If you don't already have your text editor open please open Sublime Text.</p> <p>Now you can either type in each of these tags or if you have the website up on your browser you can hit the raw button in the code box and copy and paste the content into your text editor.</p> <p>Once your done, let's save that as hello_world.html and preview in your browser by right clicking the saved file and choosing the firefox browser to preview the web page. If everything went well you should see your Hello World page.</p>
    <p>Now that we've built our first page lets talk about all of the elements or tags that make up the structure of our page.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first tag is the DOCTYPE declaration. This communicates to the browser what version of html the page is written in. Please note that this tag does not have a closing tag.</li>
        <li>Next is our html tag which tells the browser that this is an html document. The html tag contains all of the other html elements aside from the DOCTYPE declaration. You'll notice that at the very end of the code is the html closing tag.</li>
        <li>Then we have the head tag. As you can see inside the head element we have the title element which contains the required page title. The head element can also contain meta data which is information about our page, links to css style sheets which allow us to add styling and color to the page, also we can link scripts to our page to add interactivity, animation, error checking and many other features.</li>
        <li>After that we have the body tag. The body tag contains all of the contents of the html document, text, images , videos, lists, etc.</li>
        <li>finally, you'll see the h1 tag which is a heading tag, inside this tag we've placed our Hello world text.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>HTML Attributes</h5>
    <div>
        <ul>

            <li>Attributes provide <strong>additional information</strong> about an element.</li>
            <li>Attributes are always specified in the <strong>start tag</strong>.</li>
            <li>Attributes come in name/value pairs like: <strong>name="value"</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
