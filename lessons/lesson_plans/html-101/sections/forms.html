    <h5>Forms are used to collect data inputted by a user. They can be used as an interface for a web application, for example, or to send data across the web.</h5>

    <p>The basic tags used in the actual HTML of forms are form, input, textarea, select and option.</p>

    <dl class="col">
        <dt>
            <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>
        </dt>
        <dd>The<code>form</code>defines the form and within this tag, if you are using a form for a user to submit information (which we are assuming at this level), an action attribute is needed to tell the form where its contents will be sent to.
        <br><br>
        The method attribute tells the form how the data in it is going to be sent and it can have the value get, which is default, and latches the form information onto a web address, or post, which (essentially) invisibly sends the formâ€™s information.</dd>
        <dt>
            <code class="html">
                <span class="qwer">&lt;</span>
                <span class="tag">form</span>
                <span class="attribute">action</span>=
                <span class="string">"processingscript.php"</span>
                <span class="attribute">method</span>=
                <span class="string">"post"</span>
                <span class="qwer">&gt;</span>

                <span class="qwer">&lt;/</span>
                <span class="tag">form</span>
                <span class="qwer">&gt;</span>
            </code>
        </dt>
    </dl>
