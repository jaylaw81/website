    <h5>Forms are used to collect data inputted by a user. They can be used as an interface for a web application, for example, or to send data across the web.</h5>

    <p>The basic tags used in the actual HTML of forms are form, input, textarea, select and option.</p>

    <dl class="col">
        <dt>
            <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>
        </dt>
        <dd>The<code>form</code>element defines the form and within this tag, if you are using a form for a user to submit information (which we are assuming at this level), an action attribute is needed to tell the form where its contents will be sent to.
        <br><br>
        The  <code>method </code> attribute tells the form how the data in it is going to be sent and it can have the value get, which is default, and latches the form information onto a web address, or post, which (essentially) invisibly sends the form’s information.

        <code>get</code> is used for shorter chunks of non-sensitive information - you might see the information you have submitted in a web site’s search to appear in the web address of its search results page, for example. post is used for lengthier, more secure submissions, such as in contact forms.

        </dd>


        <dt>
            <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>
        </dt>
        <dd>The<code>input</code>tag is the daddy of the form world. It can take a multitude of use cases, the most common of which are outlined below.

        <code><input type="text"></code> or simply <code><input></code> is a standard textbox. This can also have a value attribute, which sets the initial text in the textbox.
        <code><input type="password"></code> is similar to the textbox, but the characters typed in by the user will be hidden.
        <code><input type="checkbox"></code> is a checkbox, which can be toggled on and off by the user. This can also have a checked attribute (<code><input type="checkbox" checked> - the attribute doesn’t require a value), and makes the initial state of the check box to be switched on, as it were.
        <code><input type="radio"></code> is similar to a checkbox, but the user can only select one radio button in a group. This can also have a checked attribute.
        <code><input type="submit"></code> is a button that when selected will submit the form. You can control the text that appears on the submit button with the value attribute, for example <code><input type="submit" value="Ooo. Look. Text on a button. Wow"></code>.
